# xIOT - My personal smart-home system

## About

This project is the front-end administrative panel of my personal smart-home management system.
The project was created as a part of my final Networking and Cybersecurity class in high-school.

## Setup

Before starting the development environment of the administrative web interface, make sure to setup the backend from the [xIOT-Server repository](https://github.com/ItsKlork/x-iot-server).
To setup the development environment, just `git clone` this project and run `npm start`.
